    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
    <p>Modern Scheduler is implemented using Python's Flask framework for the backend and SQLite for the database. Here's how some of the key features are implemented:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Users can add, update, and delete tasks. Task status is managed using predefined options (To Do, In Progress, Done, On Hold).</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Users can add, update, and delete events. Events are associated with a specific date and can have optional comments.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> The calendar view displays all tasks and events for a selected month. Tasks are color-coded based on their status.</li>
        <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Users can register, log in, and log out. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Management:</strong> Users can update their display name and password.</li>
        <li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> Users can toggle dark mode for a different visual theme.</li>
        <li><strong>History:</strong> Admin users can view login/logout and task history.</li>
    </ul>
